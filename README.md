### an interval timer app (kind of like this, but better)

CUSTOMIZABLE OPTIONS:
Number of intervals
Duration of each interval
Name of each interval
Color of each interval

MAIN SCREEN BEFORE START: Display sequence name, full screen, neutral background

MAIN SCREEN AFTER START:  Display interval name, top ¼ of screen, display countdown clock, bottom ¾ of screen; background color=custom interval color

Single screen tap to start sequence (whole screen is a button).

Once sequence begins, only two user inputs are accepted. Single tap = start next interval in sequence, four taps = stop and reset entire sequence.

At screen tap 1:
First interval starts:
Big digital clock counts down from the specified duration (minute:second)
Background color corresponds to current interval
At elapsed time:
Three-second alarm sounds
Digits change color (e.g. from black to red)
Clock begins counting up
At screen tap 2:
Next interval starts, etc…

IF screen is tapped early
THEN next interval begins
AND remaining time from short interval is recorded
(which interval? amount under time? time and date?)

IF screen is tapped late
THEN next interval begins
AND overtime from long interval is recorded
	(which interval? amount over time? time and date?)

OPTION (can be toggled on or off):
overtime/undertime is automatically subtracted/added to next interval
digits change color to indicate extended or abbreviated duration
IF PREVIOUS UNDERAGE:
digits white until time added to subsequent interval has elapsed
IF PREVIOUS OVERAGE:
digits red for entire duration of subsequent abbreviated interval

Custom sequences of intervals can be named and stored (e.g. “Opening Shift,” “Monday Workout,” etc.)

FANCY EXTRAS: haptic feedback/sound at screen tap; good typeface; good alarm sound(s); display interval number in front of interval name (toggle on/off); only display hours/minutes when interval duration is long enough to make them relevant

OTHER POSSIBLE USER INPUTS:
Double screen tap: Restarts interval
Triple screen tap: Restarts entire sequence of intervals
BUT…
Probability of user error high
This functionality not useful for me, although it would likely broaden utility / marketability
